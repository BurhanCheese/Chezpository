        <p2 class="link">https://burhanrehman-otucareerfair-ia2ux.webflow.io/</p2>
        <p>This was a project I worked on in which we needed to design a landing page for the OTU career fair using a website building tool. I decided to use webflow as it has elements of HTML and CSS, and helped me grasp the concepts in preperation for this course.</p>

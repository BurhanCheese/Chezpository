        <p>This was another assignment that I had worked on which I had to make a 3d model of a place using any builder of my choice. I chose to recreate the shinjuku cherry blosson forest in minecraft in thorough detail. This was a super enjoying project that took appoximately 100 hours of work.</p>                          <!--Explanatory text for project-->

        <p>This was a project I worked on in which we needed to design a landing page for the OTU career fair using a website building tool. I decided to use webflow as it has elements of HTML and CSS, and helped me grasp the concepts in preperation for this course.</p>                          <!--Explanatory text for project-->
